# Big Data Analysis: Gemstone Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting gemstone prices based on various attributes such as weight, clarity, and color. The goal was to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast the price of gemstones.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing gemstone data)

### Project Description
In this project, I processed a dataset containing gemstone attributes and implemented a regression model to predict gemstone prices. The key steps in this project include:

#### Data Preprocessing
Cleaning and transforming the data to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies.

#### Feature Engineering
Selecting relevant features such as weight, clarity, and color to train the model.

#### Modeling
Implementing regression algorithms (primarily Linear Regression) to predict the prices based on the input attributes.

#### Evaluation
The model achieved an impressive R² score of 92.40%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting gemstone prices.

### Steps Involved
#### Data Collection
The dataset used in this project contains various gemstone attributes, which were gathered and stored in MongoDB for efficient querying and analysis.

#### Data Exploration and Visualization
Initial analysis was done using Python's Pandas and visualization libraries (Matplotlib & Seaborn) to understand the distribution and correlations within the data.

#### Model Training
The primary model used in this project was Linear Regression, chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness for regression tasks.

#### Model Evaluation
The performance of the model was evaluated using the R² score, with the final model achieving 92.40%.

### Results
- **Model**: Linear Regression
- **R² Score**: 92.40%

### Conclusion
The project demonstrates how big data analysis techniques can be used to predict gemstone prices with a high level of accuracy. The model can be further improved by experimenting with other regression algorithms and incorporating more advanced feature engineering techniques.
